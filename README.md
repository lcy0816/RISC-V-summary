*This summary is a information gathering from the Internet*

## RISC-V on-going projects(academia) 
1.The Indian Institute of Technology Madras is developing six RISC-V open-source CPU designs for six distinct uses, from a small 32-bit CPU for the internet of things (IoT) to large, 64-bit CPUs designed for warehouse-scale computers such as server farms based on RapidIO and Hybrid Memory Cube technologies. Link is [here](http://caslab.csl.yale.edu/workshops/hasp2017/HASP17-02_slides.pdf)

Among the 6 one is for security: Experimental security oriented 64-bit variants with tagged ISA, single address space support, decoupling of protection from memory management.Link is [here](http://rise.cse.iitm.ac.in/shakti.html)

2. The Computer Laboratory, University of Cambridge, in collaboration with the FreeBSD Project, has ported the FreeBSD operating system to 64-bit RISC-V to use as a hardware-software research platform.Link is [here](http://freebsdfoundation.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/initial-freebsd-risc-v-architecture.html)

3 Sanctum is using a RISC-V rocket core to implement their design.Link is [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/564.pdf)
